# Rename Shows
Renames all the files in the directory in the form of
\[given title\] EP\[num(increments from num given)\].\[given entention\]

This is meant to be an easy way of renaming all the episodes
of a show in as when you download a season, it often contains
a bunch of matadata like subtitle language and upload group name.

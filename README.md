# Rename Shows
Renames all the files in the directory in the form of

\[given title\] EP\[num(increments from num given)\].\[given entention\]

This is meant to be an easy way of renaming all the episodes of a show. I created it because often times when you batch download a season of a show, it contains a bunch of matadata like subtitle language and upload group name. These matadata makes the episode number go off the screen in video players and it's tedious or just plain unfeasable to manually rename all the files by hand. The terminal command for this is also quite convoluted so this python script was created to solve this issue.
